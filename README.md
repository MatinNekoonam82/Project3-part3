Introduction to digital communication - quantization
In this project, we learn about converting analog signals to digital and sending and detecting digital signals. First, an analog signal is converted into a discrete signal in the transmitter, and using quantization levels, the amplitude values of the transmitted pulses are determined in digital communications. Then this process is repeated in reverse in the receiver and interpolation is used to convert discrete to continuous signal.
We generate and plot the given signal with N = 50,000 samples
